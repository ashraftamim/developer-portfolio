    <h3>professional Coder and experianced programmer</h3>
    <p>I always wanted to be a programmer.
        growing up i had an interest in technology
        and computers.
        So life has bought me to jhanker mahbub sir's coding course.Manchester-based studio ToyFight(opens in new tab) uses a number of whizzy effects 
         from parallax scrolling to animated transitions and even 3D rendered versions of the studio's founders fighting each other. All of this could threaten to overwhelm the work on show
          but seeing as it's been executed with such visual humour and panache, the site is a joy to explore. This is a good lesson in how personality can also sell creatives' 
         work.</p>
